# Changelog

## v1.1.13
- **Performance**: Drastically reduced API load on the YouTrack server by completely removing issue count API calls on the main dashboard screen. The widget now loads instantly.
- **Feature**: Added support for displaying the native `description` field with safe Markdown rendering (bold, links) in the tooltip.
- **Feature**: Replaced raw HTML rendering with a lightweight, 100% XSS-safe custom Markdown parser.
- **Feature**: Added field aliases support in the "Columns to Display" selector (e.g. `State (S)`).
- **Fix**: Resolved an issue where custom fields (like Priority) would disappear from the dropdown due to strict API 400 Bad Request errors when fetching aliases. Added automatic safe-fallback queries.
- **UI**: Added a sensible set of default fields for newly created widgets.
- **Feature**: Added a dedicated "Project Context" selector in settings to easily load project-specific custom fields for the columns dropdown.
- **Enhancement**: The Project Context selector automatically detects and selects the project if `project: <PROJECT_ID>` is written in the main YouTrack Query.
- **UI**: Improved the widget configuration layout by moving the YouTrack Query to the top and arranging settings more compactly.
- **UI**: Cleaned up the table view and Excel exports by stripping markdown formatting (e.g. `**bold**`, links) to ensure pristine plain text display.
- **UX**: Added a native YouTrack toast notification upon successful Excel report download.
