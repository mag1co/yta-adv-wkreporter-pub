# Adv.Weekly Reporter for YouTrack

A powerful, highly configurable YouTrack widget that generates grouped reports of issues and allows exporting them directly to XLSX, complete with comments and clickable links.

Works as both a Dashboard Widget and a Project Tab widget.

## Key Features

- **Custom JQL/Query** — Build reports based on any YouTrack search query directly from the settings.
- **Project Context** — Automatically load project-specific custom fields. Auto-detects the project directly from your search query!
- **Dynamic Columns** — Select exactly which fields to display in your report, including standard fields, custom fields with aliases (e.g., `State (S)`), and descriptions.
- **Rich Comments & Descriptions** — View the latest issue comment or the full issue description directly in the table with safe HTML/Markdown rendering via tooltips.
- **Comprehensive XLSX Export** — Instantly export the current report view to an Excel spreadsheet with clickable hyperlinks and clean, markdown-stripped plain text.
- **High Performance** — The main dashboard loads instantly with zero lag thanks to heavily optimized YouTrack API requests.
- **Deep Pagination** — Handles large datasets flawlessly by streaming all matching issues via the YouTrack API without artificial limits.
- **Auto-Refresh** — Keep your dashboards up to date with configurable auto-refresh intervals.
- **Browser-Native Export** — The XLSX generation runs entirely in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.
